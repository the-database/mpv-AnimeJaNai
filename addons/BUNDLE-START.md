# Try the addon foundation

For the complete standalone reference, open **DEVELOPER-GUIDE.html**. It includes
the tutorial, API declarations, feature examples and release/testing instructions
in one document, including instructions for use with an LLM.

For a step-by-step first addon, open **CREATOR-GUIDE.html** in your browser.
It runs entirely from this bundle with PowerShell 7 and the downloaded compiler.
For installation and Manager controls, read **USER-GUIDE.html**.

This standalone Windows x64 developer preview exercises the addon host. .NET is included; no SDK or GPU setup is required to run the counter example. Native sessions and frame samples additionally require a matching AJN installation and explicit media/profile approvals; see `NATIVE-MEDIA.md` and `FRAMES.md`, or use the integrated preview. The generic sample inspector exercises binary image samples and host timers. Plex and lighting addons are not included.

The service inspector exercises approved HTTP/UDP destinations and optional
saved header credentials. Use Manager to review access before invoking its
request action. It sends nothing on startup; see `NETWORK.md` for its limits.

The output inspector exercises processed video/audio delivery to an approved
HTTP receiver. It requires the matching integrated native output runtime and
NVIDIA encoding hardware. It sends nothing until its explicit action is used.
See `OUTPUTS.md` for source/profile/receiver permissions and supported formats.

The player inspector observes small images from ordinary AJN playback after its
two permissions are approved. It requires a matching integrated native build.
See `PLAYER-FRAMES.md` for shared observations, limits and the example actions.

The HTTP inspector and bridge demonstrate approved listeners, responses, native
proxying and client credential validation. The media stream example probes an
approved source and serves processed output through AJN. Open `HTTP-SERVER.html`
and `STREAMING.html` for setup and contracts. These examples default to loopback;
the media example is a local diagnostic, not a production client authorization
policy. Streaming additionally requires the matching native runtime and a
supported GPU/profile. The release's test report identifies what was measured.

Extract the ZIP to a writable folder. Open PowerShell 7 there and run:

```powershell
./tools/run-example.ps1
```

The script installs the bundled counter addon with permissions to log and read/write its own storage. It runs the addon inside Wasmtime and saves its data in `example-data` beside the bundle. Run it again to verify that the counter survives restart. It does not grant network, general file, or process access.

Read and change a setting:

```powershell
./host/ajn-addon.exe settings org.animejanai.counter ./example-data
'{"greeting":"Good evening"}' | Set-Content ./greeting.json -Encoding utf8NoBOM
./host/ajn-addon.exe configure org.animejanai.counter ./example-data ./greeting.json
./host/ajn-addon.exe action org.animejanai.counter ./example-data ./runtime/wasmtime.exe status
./host/ajn-addon.exe replay org.animejanai.counter ./example-data ./runtime/wasmtime.exe ./examples/counter/events.json
```

For your own addon, download the pinned official developer tools first. This is a separate, explicit download and does not execute addon setup scripts:

```powershell
./tools/bootstrap.ps1
$tools = Get-Content ./.tools/tools.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
./host/ajn-addon.exe new ./my-addon org.example.mine
# Edit my-addon/addon.js and manifest.json, then:
./host/ajn-addon.exe build ./my-addon $tools.javy.path ./my-addon.ajnaddon
./host/ajn-addon.exe inspect ./my-addon.ajnaddon
```

See `README.md`, `API.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` for installation permissions, limits, and remaining integration work. Buildable AJN host/SDK source is in `source`. Wasmtime's license is in `licenses`; its official source is at https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/v48.0.2. The counter's compiled JavaScript runtime comes from Javy 9.1.0 at https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/tree/v9.1.0.
