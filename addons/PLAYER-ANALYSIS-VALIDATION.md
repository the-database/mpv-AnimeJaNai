# Player analysis qualification — 2026-10-29

This is API 1.12 on the 3.9.0 addon integration branch, not a claim that the public 3.9.0 release contains these APIs. The matched preview's `build-info/addon-preview.json` records its exact source commits and evidence. The lighting addon and physical light controllers are separate work.

## 3.9.0 integration preview

The integration includes the exact public 3.9.0 main release, Manager 0.10.3 and inference v0.17.1. The Windows player base and optional runtime versions are unchanged from the previous preview, so its already-tested addon mpv build is reused. API 1.12, the SDK and host implementation are unchanged. Manager keeps the 3.9.0 interface and Temporal Fix controls alongside Addons and Troubleshooting. Optional component downloads use the public 3.9.0 component release.

The merged Manager, updater and inference runtime compiled. Existing Manager configuration/Temporal Fix round trips, diagnostics and addon UI checks passed; the headless UI fixture now matches Avalonia 12.1 and waits for dialog continuations before the next action. All 15 updater regressions passed. Real mpv/mpv.net analysis passed again on the merged runtime, including seeks, shared observers, software-decoding rejection and last-observer cleanup. The inactive check found no analysis module/filter and no added playback drops; the short active check also added no drops. The existing RIFE addon hook and continuous/segmented streaming checks passed. Two stacked temporal stages, including the new Temporal Fix configuration key, produced all 12 expected frames on DirectML and TensorRT with maximum luma error 0.25 and complete EOF draining. TensorRT used the previously qualified dynamic-shape fixture.

The long-path correction below remains included without changes. The 195 host checks and long-path cache creation/reuse were already qualified before this port and were not repeated; their evidence is retained separately from these 3.9.0 checks. Physical light-controller testing remains separate addon work.

## Preview 2: Windows long-path correction

The theater-lighting consumer's verification exposed a cache-lock failure in mpv.net at a long installation path. The optional analysis module now normalizes the model path into Windows extended-path form before deriving the cache, lock and temporary paths. Model/engine existence checks, reads, writes and cache publication all use that form. Windows file failures include their numeric error code. The change runs during optional setup/file I/O; per-frame analysis and normal playback code are unchanged. API and addon package versions do not need to change.

The focused regression passed in two fresh **mpv.net** processes with a **286-character model path**, **354-character engine path** and **359-character lock path**. The first built and saved an engine and returned a real color/mask pair; the second returned a pair without rebuilding or changing the cache file. Both unsubscribed and exited normally. The test used existing matched runtime components and a verified ONNX, not a new dependency download. The creator guide now explicitly explains the TensorRT runtime/GPU-kernel prerequisite and Manager's Components setup.

The baseline evidence below was collected for preview 1 and is retained. The 195 host checks and broader playback/performance tests were not repeated for this setup-only path correction.

## Baseline implementation and tests

- The real `character-mask` JavaScript example was compiled to Wasm, installed with reviewed permissions, and run through the public broker in Windows mpv and mpv.net. It received source color and nontrivial IS-Net masks from 1920×1080 Frieren footage using NVDEC/Vulkan, with upscaling and RIFE off. Exported color/mask pairs were inspected visually.
- The fixed SHA256 model and its exact float input/output shapes were verified. TensorRT built an engine locally, then loaded it during playback. A discovered Windows builder-resource search-path problem was fixed and a fresh engine build passed from the workspace directory.
- Seeking changed the epoch and produced a pair at the new PTS. Two separate Wasm addons shared one native producer at different sizes; stopping one preserved the other. Last unsubscribe removed the filter and unloaded `aji_analysis.dll` while playback continued.
- Source observations survived a file change and remained before the processing filter with upscaling and RIFE enabled. Source geometry remained 480×360 while the rendered output was 960×720; the player log confirmed active 2× RIFE.
- A separate compiled Wasm fixture received source color-only samples with just `player.observe` and `frames.read`, without `player.analysis` or mask data. Unsupported software decoding returned an explicit error and did not load the GPU module.
- Existing DirectML/D3D11 player-observation checks passed, including two players, independent sizes, seeks, file changes, other-addon stop, host termination and lease cleanup. The native RIFE scene-hook check passed after its missing legacy RIFE model fixture was supplied.
- 195 host checks passed, including the previously distributed API 1.0 Wasm binary, ownership/grants, paired-data bounds, initial waiting status, and unchanged scene/network/streaming examples. Manager and both native components compiled. Manager retained existing Windows-platform analyzer warnings.

## Measured cost and inactive behavior

One RTX 5090, SDR 1080p anime, 160×90 output, requested maximum 12 analyses/s, five-second observation windows:

| Measurement | Inactive | Active character analysis | After unsubscribe |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Additional playback drops during window | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Player CPU, percentage of one logical core | 4.0% | 11.4% | See raw evidence |
| Player working set | 587 MiB | 703 MiB | 633 MiB |
| Optional analysis DLL loaded | No | Yes | No |

The 43 pairs read during the active window averaged 8.58 ms of optional GPU work/readback, with a maximum recorded sample age of 9.99 ms. Read frequency and the maximum analysis rate are different: this diagnostic reader polled at 10 Hz and may skip completed pairs. Timings are processing timings, not display or light-output latency. Driver/runtime caches mean process memory need not return exactly to its cold value after cleanup. This short single-machine check is not a performance guarantee for other GPUs or heavily loaded upscaling chains.

No addon subscription means no sample filter, analysis worker, model load/download, CUDA sample buffers or per-frame analysis work. Normal `aji.dll` and `aji_trt.dll` do not import the optional analysis module. Estimation, temporal smoothing, calibration, routing and light-control policy belong in the addon. When active, only reduced color/mask results are read back; decoded full frames and model inference stay on the GPU.

## Limits of this qualification

Character masks currently support NVIDIA CUDA progressive mono SDR inputs. HDR analysis, AMD/DirectML segmentation, Linux, physical lights, projector matching, long-duration performance and all source pixel formats remain unqualified. The live tests used the already-downloaded, verified ONNX; automatic first-use HTTP provisioning is implemented but was not separately exercised by these playback tests. Native setup cancellation and CUDA host-loss cleanup are implemented; only ordinary unsubscribe was directly measured on the new CUDA path. Existing host-loss checks cover the shared lifecycle and D3D11 path.

See [PLAYER-ANALYSIS.md](PLAYER-ANALYSIS.md) for the public contract and [DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md), Appendix F, for a self-contained example. No physical light system was contacted during qualification.
